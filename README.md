# Agile 
### Agile principles
- An agile project is segmented into several incremental steps that include regular feedback intervals.
- A project requirement is segmented into smaller pieces, which are then prioritized by importance.
- Promotes collaboration, especially with the customer. 
- Adjusts at regular intervals to ensure a customerâ€™s needs are met
- Integrates planning with execution, which allows a team to effectively respond to changing requirements
* Agile is a methodology used in development
* It is an iterative approach to delivering a project, focusing on continuous realeases that incorporate customer feedback

# Scrum
- An agile project management framework used to develop, deliver and sustain products
- Continuously shipping value to customers
- Framework for getting work done (while agile is a set of values and principles)
- Embraces change
- A product is built in a series of iterations called sprints (break down big complex projects into smaller pieces)
  - Allows for higher quality work delivered more frequently, while giving more flexibility to adapt and change
- Short iteration help reduce risk and costs for the client, get fast feedback from customers, see value quicker
- Milestones come at the end of a sprint/iteration which give the development team a sense of achievement and progress made
